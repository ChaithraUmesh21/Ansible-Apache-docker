# Ansible-Apache-docker
Automated Container deployment and Administration

A public GitHub repository will be created to document the process. 
Using Ansible, a Docker container will be deployed, running an Apache service hosting a static web page.
Configuration will be set up to enable network communication within the container and ensure accessibility from the host machine.
Additionally, a network diagram will be crafted to illustrate the container operating on the 172.168.10.0/30 subnet.
Traffic originating from the host machine will be permitted to access the container subnet.
This comprehensive approach encompasses repository management, infrastructure deployment, network configuration, and visualization, ensuring a holistic understanding and execution of the task.
Through these steps, a functional and accessible environment will be established, providing a solid foundation for further development and experimentation.
